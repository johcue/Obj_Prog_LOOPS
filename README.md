# Object Oriented Programming - LOOPS
1. Write a program that reads n real numbers from the keyboard and finds the average, maximum, and minimum of those values (WHILE, DOWHILE, FOR)
2. Read a sentence from the canvas character by character, until the <enter> key is pressed. Indicates how many vowels the sentence has, number of consonants and the number of other characters (DO-WHILE)
3. An employee of the tiki taka store makes n sales during the day, it is required to know how many of them were greater than $100, how many were greater than $500 but less than $100, and how many were less than $500. In addition, it would be necessary to know the amount of what was sold in each category and globally (WHILE)
4.it is known that n^2= 1+3+5+7+2n-1. You are asked to read a number and calculate its square using this relation (FOR).
5. Write a program that reads a number n from the keyboard and tells us the distances between each pair of contiguous primes less than n (FOR, WHILE).
6. Write a program that gives the value of e^x using the taylor series approximation
7. Write a program that reads an integer and determines if that number is armstrong number.
8. The first car is 70 kilometers away on the Pereira-Cali highway, another is 150 kilometers away on the same road, the first is traveling in the direction of Cali, while the second is headed for Pereira, at the same speed. At what kilometer of the road will they meet? (WHILE)
9. Design a program that calculates the least common multiple between two numbers that are read by keyboard (FOR).
